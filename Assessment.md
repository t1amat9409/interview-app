# About

This app is for interview purposes -  a simple app that was bootstrapped using CRA with a TypeScript template.
The app lists a top stackoverflow users in chunks of 20 people per page, with both the next and prev button at the bottom to allow for an easy pagination. The app is designed mobile first using `styled-components` as the base styling system. Also the app uses the React Context api for a global app state management allowing request data/errors/load state to be globally accessed by the app components. I've roughly spent around 2 - 3 hours on the app.

## Design

- Roughly around 1 hour spent working on the app design
- Chose `styled-components` as base styling system - I can't support much as to why I've chosen this, it's a personal preference.

## Review

- Roughly around 15 min spent reviewing code and fixing possible bugs  

## Implementation

- An 1.5 hours was spent on the app functionality
- Chose to go with context api for global state management, I prefer to use as less libraries as possible if there's another perfect solution to a problem, for me context api came handy for this app.

## Testing

- Reached a request limit while trying to implement pagination on the app, was block by stackexhange for over 17 hours couldn't wait for that because I need to submit.

## Documentation

- About 15 - 20min spent writing this documentation

## Blockers

- Reached a limit while testing the pagination, couldn't get to work on some of the stuff I wanted to implement
